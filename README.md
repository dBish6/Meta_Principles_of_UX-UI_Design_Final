# Meta_Principles_of_UX-UI_Design_Final
I would like to share my final assignment from the Meta Principles of UX/UI Design course. While I didn't have the opportunity to fully showcase my skills, I believe that my work demonstrates my understanding of the design process. The Figma file includes a persona, journey map, wireframe, and prototype, which collectively illustrates my approach to user-centered design.
